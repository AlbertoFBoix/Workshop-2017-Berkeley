Since this workshop is only 3 days, we adopt a fairly aggressive schedule like that used at the Boise workshop in an effort to maximize our time together.  Also, most of you will already be at the conference and have planned to depart on Saturday, so we include on the schedule for the 3 days of intensive Macaulay2 workshop here.
