-- goal #1:
    given (d,g,s) (s=2,3,4), and also a field (ZZ/p, for not small p, or QQ).
    -- return an ideal of a smooth curve of degree d, genus g, smallest surface of degree s.
    -- also do: CI, ACM.

    return values:
      1. ideal
      2. null: "DoesNotExist"
      3. it exists, but no example is known.

    1. given class (a,b) on a quadric surface, give a random smooth curve in that class.
    2. given h-vector of ACM curve, give an example of that. (determines d,g,s).
    3. given class on a cubic surface (a, b1, ..., b6), produce a smooth example.
    4. given a Rao module, produce a minimal example of a smooth curve in the equivalence class.
    5. non-special curves
    6. special, but h^1(OO_C(1)) <= 1.
