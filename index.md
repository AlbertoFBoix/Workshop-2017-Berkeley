## About the conference

With funding from the National Science Foundation and the Mathematics Department
at the University of Illinois, we are organizing a
Macaulay2 school and research meeting at University of Illinois
Urbana-Champaign, from Monday, June 16, 2014 through Friday, June 20, 2014
with Sunday, June 15 and Saturday, June 21 serving as the travel days.  


## Research Meeting


The research meeting will take place from June 18-20, open to all who wish to
attend, with talks ranging from high-level descriptions of research in where
computational algebra plays an important role to descriptions of advances in
computational algebra systems and packages. There is a large and vital
community of people using the system in a wide variety of ways, from
computational biology to string theory to algebraic geometry. Because the
spread of fields is great, many do not know the techniques that the others are
using. One purpose of the research meeting is to bring together these disparate
communities and foster bridges between them.  



Funding to defray the costs of travel, lodging, and subsistence is available
for those wishing to attend the research meeting.



For planning purposes, we request those who intend to attend the research
meeting to register at [http://tinyurl.com/m5j3qdk](http://tinyurl.com/m5j3qdk), 
and to indicate their request for funding, if any.  Feel free to re-register to 
amend your information.  Those who wish to apply for funding should do so by 
April 4, 2014.


<h2>Macaulay2 School</h2>


The school will take place June 16-17, and although space is limited, all who
wish to attend are invited to apply. The school will center on three tutorial
sessions:

* Greg Smith: Toric Varieties
* Dan Bates: Numerical Algebraic Geometry
* Josephine Yu: Tropical Geometry



We plan to include a mix of advanced graduate students, recent postdocs,
and some senior people who are relatively inexperienced with Macaulay2 for
hands on training.  Funding is available to defray the costs of travel,
lodging, and subsistence; indicate that you wish to attend on the
registration form mentioned above. Please also include a short statement of
purpose on why you wish to attend.  Graduate students and postdocs should
also arrange for a letter of endorsement from their advisor to be sent to
[Sonja Mapes &lt;smapes1@nd.edu&gt;](mailto:smapes1@nd.edu).  Those who wish to 
attend should do so by April 4, 2014.


Those who wish to attend the school should commit to being present for the 5
days of the school and meeting, and should install Macaulay2 on the laptops
they will bring with them to the school and ensure that it runs.
