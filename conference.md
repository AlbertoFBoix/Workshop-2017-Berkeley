### Abstracts


* Jason McCullough - The Projective Dimension of 3 Cubics


Stillman's Question, recently answered in the affirmative by Ananyan-Hochster, asks whether there exists a bound on the projective dimension of homogeneous ideals in polynomial rings over a field depending only on the degrees of the generators.  While the Ananyan-Hochster result shows there is such a bound in all cases, what the optimal answer is remains unknown in almost all cases.  Previously Engheta had shown that if I = (f,g,h) is an ideal in a polynomial ring S generated by 3 cubic forms, then the projective dimension of S/I is at most 36, while the largest known example had projective dimension 5.  I will sketch the proof that 5 is indeed the maximum projective dimension of S/I, where I is generated by 3 cubics.  This is joint work with Paolo Mantero.


* Frank-Olaf Schreyer - Balancing in relative canonical resolutions and a unirational moduli space of  K3 surfaces


I report on work of two of my students: Christian Bopp and Michael Hoff. Given a curve C of genus g together with a rational function f:C -> P^1 of degree d the canonical model lies on a rational normal scroll X, and the resolution of O_C as an O_X module is build with certain vector bundle N_i on P^1. It is interesting to ask whether the splitting type of the N_i is balanced for a general pair (C,f), since then jump loci lead to interesting subspaces of the Hurwitz scheme H_{g,d}. By experiment Bopp and Hoff discovered that the second syzygy bundle N_2
is not balanced for (g,d)=(9,6) for finite fields. In the talk I will explain how their proof in characteristic zero builds upon a moduli space of certain lattice polarized K3 surfaces.
