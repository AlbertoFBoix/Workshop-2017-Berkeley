#####Lodging

Even in summer, Berkeley housing can fill up quickly,
so participants are encouraged to make reservations
as early as possible (for example, the Mens Faculty
Club is already booked up, whereas Hotel Durant and
Rose Inn have availability). A good list of options
is at the [MSRI short term housing site] (http://www.msri.org/web/msri/for-visitors/housing-information/short-term-housing).
